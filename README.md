## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Backend: Node.js + Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Password Security: bcrypt
- Validation: express-validator
- API Testing: Postman

🚀 Setup & Run

1.Clone the Repository : https://github.com/Likithsomanna7/Basic-Activity-Booking-App.git
2.Install Dependencies : npm install
3.Start the server : npm start
4.After creating a Postman collection, you should continue adding separate requests for each API endpoint, such as POST /api/register, POST /api/login, and include the necessary headers and body data. If you're using a MongoDB database on your local machine, your API's base URL might be something like http://localhost:5000, assuming your backend is running on port 5000 and connected to MongoDB via a URI such as mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/yourdbname
